A female cat is called a queen or a molly.
Cats lose almost as much fluid in the saliva while grooming themselves as they do through urination.
A cat can’t climb head first down a tree because every claw on a cat’s paw points the same way. To get down from a tree, a cat must back down.
Cats with long, lean bodies are more likely to be outgoing, and more protective and vocal than those with a stocky build.
The normal body temperature of a cat is between 100.5 ° and 102.5 °F. A cat is sick if its temperature goes below 100 ° or above 103 °F.
